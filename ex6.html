    <p id="topic1"><strong>1. What is HTML?</strong></p>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
        Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag to define the structure of web pages.<br>
        This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. <br>Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. 
        The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.,<br>
        In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.
        Tim Berners-Lee is known as the father of HTML. <br>
        The first available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. <br>
        The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which we will learn later in this tutorial.<br>

    <p>HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are used to define the structure and content of web pages.<br>
        HTML uses predefined tags and elements that tell the browser how to display the content.<br>
         HTML elements include an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag.<br>
        Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page,<br>
